Question two: Design a dynamic system to assist university students in planning their course schedules, considering the prerequisites required for each course, changing course offerings, 
and individual academic progress. This system could integrate with real-time registration systems, provide feedback on course fulfillment, and help students navigate their academic courses 
efficiently, avoiding scheduling conflicts and unnecessary delays in their educational journey.
